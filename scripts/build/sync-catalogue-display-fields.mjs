/**
 * Propagate catalogue-owned display fields into the render record.
 *
 * WHY 234 OF 371 BASELINED PARITY FINDINGS ARE ONE BUG
 *
 * The catalogue/render parity check carries 371 pinned findings. Classified in full on
 * 2026-08-22 they are not 371 problems but a handful of causes, and the two largest are
 * the same shape:
 *
 *   164  render record dropped a keyword the catalogue records (search terms lost)
 *    70  render record dropped a style property the catalogue sets
 *
 * The render records were assembled once, by promote-test-converted-layers.mjs, which
 * merged the catalogue's keywords at that moment. Nothing re-synced them afterwards. So
 * every keyword added to the catalogue since — every search term, every jurisdiction tag
 * — exists in maps.json and not in the record the renderer actually reads. Measured
 * before this script: 166 layers losing keywords, 66 losing style properties.
 *
 * It is a live defect, not bookkeeping. Those keywords are search terms, so a layer
 * tagged "connacht" or "civil parish" in the catalogue is not findable by them in the
 * app.
 *
 * MERGE, DO NOT REPLACE, in both directions:
 *
 *   keywords  UNION. The render record legitimately adds its own ("maplibre",
 *             "vector tiles", the category and group names). Replacing with the
 *             catalogue's set would delete those.
 *   style     FILL MISSING KEYS ONLY. A render record may deliberately override a
 *             colour for the vector renderer; the finding is that it DROPPED a property,
 *             not that it changed one. Overwriting would trade 70 findings for however
 *             many deliberate overrides exist.
 *
 * Runs inside `npm run build`, so it cannot drift again. --check fails instead of
 * writing, which is what the gate uses.
 *
 *   node scripts/build/sync-catalogue-display-fields.mjs
