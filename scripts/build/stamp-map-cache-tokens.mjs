/**
 * Stamp content-derived cache tokens onto catalogue FGB URLs.
 *
 * THE FAILURE THIS FIXES
 *
 * On 2026-08-16 five corrected Local Authority layers were uploaded to their
 * existing R2 keys. The bytes at the edge were verified sha256-identical to the
 * reviewed files, and the contributor still could not see the change.
 *
 * The reason is that data.civgraph.net sends NO Cache-Control header at all --
 * only ETag and Last-Modified. With no explicit freshness, browsers fall back to
 * heuristic caching (RFC 9111 4.2.2), which is commonly 10% of the document's
 * age. Those files had been stable since the 2026-05-09 ingest, so they were
 * ~99 days old, giving roughly TEN DAYS of freshness during which the browser
 * does not even revalidate. The correction was live and invisible.
 *
 * Note how badly that fails: the longer a layer has been stable, the longer a
 * correction to it takes to reach anyone who has already looked at it. The
 * cache behaves worst exactly where the data is most established.
 *
 * Cache-Control on the bucket would bound that, and should still be set. But it
 * cannot help the person already holding a stale entry, because their freshness
 * lifetime was computed when they stored it. Only a different URL reaches them,
 * which is what this does.
 *
 * WHY THE ETAG AND NOT A HAND-PICKED NUMBER
 *
 * Principle 3: derive values, do not maintain them. A hand-bumped `?v=2` is one
 * forgotten edit away from being a lie, and this project has already shipped
 * that exact bug -- browse/browse.js once went a whole day serving old code
 * behind a stale token. R2's ETag is the object's own content hash, so the token
 * cannot drift from the bytes it names: re-upload and it changes, leave the file
 * alone and it does not.
 *
 * A HEAD request is enough to read it, so this costs no body transfer.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/build/stamp-map-cache-tokens.mjs --check          # gate: tokens match live objects
 *   node scripts/build/stamp-map-cache-tokens.mjs --write          # restamp every tokened URL
 *   node scripts/build/stamp-map-cache-tokens.mjs --write --id X   # add or refresh one entry
