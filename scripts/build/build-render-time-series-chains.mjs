/**
 * Populate `timeSeriesChains` in the render metadata from the catalogue.
 *
 * WHY THE /render/ TIME-SERIES PANEL HAS NEVER WORKED
 *
 * render/index.html:182 mounts #timeSeriesPanel, render/src/time-series-panel.js renders
 * it, and TimeSeriesController.switchLayerToDate() swaps a loaded layer to another date
 * in its chain. All of it is wired up. None of it has ever done anything, because
 * render/metadata/maps-test.json carried `timeSeriesChains: []` while the catalogue
 * carried 17 chains and 44 classes. Measured 2026-08-23 at /render/ with
 * provinces-1955 loaded: the panel read "No converted time-series chains."
 *
 * A SECOND mismatch sat underneath, which would have bitten the moment the first was
 * fixed. TimeSeriesController reads `chain.maps` with entries carrying `.id` and `.date`,
 * and matches against RENDER layer ids ("provinces-1955-vector"), not catalogue map
 * ids ("provinces-1955").
 *
 * ONE CHAIN SHAPE, since 2026-08-26. The catalogue used to describe membership FOUR ways
 * -- `segments`, a flat `classIds`, a direct `maps` list, and `parallel` + `columns` --
 * and the first version of this script handled only the first, so it emitted 5 of 17
 * chains and left the other 12 exactly as dead as they had been. Nothing failed; the code
 * found no chains and rendered a polite empty state.
 *
 * The four were folded into `segments[]` upstream, in the catalogue, so this reads one
 * shape and no longer compensates for four. Nothing was lost in the fold: a segment can
 * name its members by CLASS (`classIds`) or by MAP (`mapIds`), carry a `from`/`to` window,
 * and carry a `column` name for a parallel chain.
 *
 * Segment `from`/`to` are honoured. The `wards` chain is ni-wards from 1972 and ni-deds
 * to 1971; ignoring the window would pull post-1972 wards into a segment ending in 1971.
 *
 * A `parallel` chain emits ONE CHAIN PER COLUMN rather than one merged list. Its three
 * columns -- UK Parliament, Dail Eireann, Devolved NI -- are separate series displayed
 * side by side. Merging them would let the picker "switch" a Westminster constituency map
 * to a Dail one at a nearby date, which is not a continuation of anything.
 *
 * `parliamentary` also declares a chain-level `predecessor` (pre-1921-pcs, to
 * 1920-12-31). It is deliberately NOT attached to any column, and is reported instead. It
 * precedes the UK Parliament and Dail series equally, and the Devolved NI series arguably
 * not at all; the data says which CLASSES it covers but not which COLUMNS it belongs to.
 * Attaching it to one would be a guess, and to all three would assert that pre-partition
 * Westminster seats precede the NI Assembly.
 *
 * Placeholders, hidden records and UNDATED maps are dropped: a chain entry that cannot be
 * loaded is a date the picker offers and then fails to honour, and an undated one would
 * render an <option value> of literally "undefined".
 *
 * Runs inside `npm run build`, so it cannot drift. --check fails instead of writing.
 *
 *   node scripts/build/build-render-time-series-chains.mjs
