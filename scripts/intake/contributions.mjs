/**
 * Turn approved contributions into a git branch. Run by the owner, locally.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A LOCAL SCRIPT AND NOT AN ENDPOINT
 *
 * The boundary between "requesting a change" and "enacting one" has to rest on
 * something. If approval wrote to the catalogue directly, that boundary would
 * rest on functions/_api/contributions/decide.js being correct -- on requireAdmin,
 * on the allowlist parsing, on no forged header ever reaching it. This session
 * alone found a fail-open allowlist and an authentication bypass in that same
 * auth module, so it is not a foundation worth building on.
 *
 * Instead the boundary rests on who can push to main. GitHub enforces that, and
 * no bug in the Functions layer can weaken it. The edge can mark a submission
 * approved; only someone with the repository and a terminal can turn that into
 * a commit, and even then it arrives as a branch to be reviewed rather than as
 * a change to main.
 *
 * Nothing here writes to R2, D1 or main. It edits working-tree files on a new
 * branch, runs the validators, and stops.
 *
 * THE QUEUE NEEDS A TERMINAL STATE, AND THIS IS IT
 *
 * Until 2026-08-16 "approved" was the last status a submission could reach. Two
 * consequences, and the second one cost a support round trip:
 *
 *   - This script REFUSES kind "map-submission" on purpose -- turning one into a
 *     layer needs a licence determination, conversion and tiling, none of which
 *     can be done mechanically. So those never advanced past approved even after
 *     the work was finished by hand.
 *   - Even for the kinds it does handle, it stops at a branch. Nothing marked a
 *     submission done once that branch was merged.
 *
 * So --list reported "5 approved and not yet applied" for five layers that had
 * been corrected, uploaded, and byte-verified at the edge nine hours earlier.
 * The queue said the opposite of the truth, and it was going to say it forever.
 *
 * `--mark-applied` closes that. It is deliberately a separate, explicit step
 * rather than something the apply path does for you: at the moment this script
 * finishes, the change is a branch nobody has merged, and calling that "applied"
 * would replace one lie with another. Mark it after the merge, or after doing
 * the work by hand -- which is the only route a map-submission has.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/intake/contributions.mjs --list
 *   node scripts/intake/contributions.mjs --apply <submission-id> [<id>...]
 *   node scripts/intake/contributions.mjs --apply-all-approved
 *   node scripts/intake/contributions.mjs --apply <id> --dry-run
 *   node scripts/intake/contributions.mjs --mark-applied <id> --note "what was done"
 *
 * Requires wrangler auth for KV access (the queue is not readable anonymously).
