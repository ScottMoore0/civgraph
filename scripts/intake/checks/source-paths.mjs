/**
 * A layer's sourceFile must point at the live intake cache, not a superseded one.
 *
 * WHY. Sources are staged under render/source-cache/, which is gitignored and periodically
 * cleaned. When a delivery is unpacked into a dated directory of its own -- for example
 * render/source-cache/idb-20260609/ -- the layers built from it keep that path forever,
 * and the path stops resolving the moment the directory is removed.
 *
 * The failure is quiet. build-test-pmtiles reports the layer as "missing-source" and
 * carries on, so a rebuild silently does nothing and the layer keeps serving whatever it
 * was last built from. On 2026-08-03 seven Electoral Division layers were in this state,
 * pointing into a June delivery that no longer existed, and a re-cut of all of them
 * appeared to succeed while changing nothing.
 *
 * Deliveries should be unpacked outside the repository and staged into the single live
 * cache directory, so that a path either resolves or is obviously wrong.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/intake/checks/source-paths.mjs [--metadata <path>]...
 *
 * --metadata may be repeated to check specific files instead of the defaults. Tests pass
 * copies under a temporary directory so that exercising a failure never requires editing,
 * and then reverting, a tracked file.
