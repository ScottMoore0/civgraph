/**
 * Every file in a recorded delivery must be ingested or explicitly deferred.
 *
 * WHY. On 2026-07-26 Phelim delivered 95 new .fgb files. Twenty were ingested on 31 July
 * and the remaining seventy-five were not. Nothing noticed for a month, because nothing
 * compared what arrived against what was taken in: the intake manifest lives under
 * render/source-cache/, which is gitignored, so there is no history of it and no review.
 * The gap surfaced only when the contributor reported that his maps had not changed.
 *
 * This reconciles data/intake/<delivery>.json -- the committed record of what arrived --
 * against the layer metadata. A delivered file counts as accounted for when some layer's
 * sourceFile names it, or when the delivery lists it under `deferred` with a reason.
 *
 * Deferring is a legitimate answer. Ingesting a file that has no catalogue record means
 * deciding where it belongs, and that can need the contributor. The point is that the
 * decision is recorded rather than implied by silence.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/intake/checks/delivery.mjs [--intake-dir <path>] [--metadata <path>]...
 *
 * The path arguments exist so tests can point at copies under a temporary directory,
 * rather than mutating a tracked file and relying on a revert afterwards.
