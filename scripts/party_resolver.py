"""Shared resolver: (party string, body, date) -> a party_registry.json entity id.

Two passes, because a party string is not reliable evidence of what a candidate stood
as at the time. Six candidacies in this dataset carry a label outside the life of the
organisation named — three applied retrospectively (Samuel as 'Green' in 1987 and 1989,
McCartney as 'UKUP' in 1995) and three outliving the party (Craig, Dunlop and Overend as
Vanguard in 1982, four and a half years after it dissolved).

    pass 1  alias matches on string + body + alias window, AND the candidacy falls
            inside the entity's own [founded, dissolved) lifespan  ->  ('ok', id)
    pass 2  exactly one entity claims the string for that body, but the date is outside
            its lifespan                                            ->  ('outside', id)
    else    ('none', None) or ('ambiguous', [ids])

Pass 2 attributes the candidacy rather than dropping it, because the votes really do
belong to that organisation; the caller decides whether to count it and can report the
exposure. Dropping to the raw string instead would be worse than useless -- it splits
one party in two while silently merging another whose raw string happens to equal its
short name.
