"""Check the explicit party lifespans against the election results.

data/elections/parties/party_lifespans.json asserts when each party was founded and,
where applicable, dissolved. Those are facts about the organisations, supplied with a
source. This script does the one thing that makes them worth having: it confronts them
with the contest record and reports where the two disagree.

RESOLUTION. A candidacy is matched to a party by its `party` string, optionally narrowed
by `bodySlug`, and then by date. Membership is the HALF-OPEN interval [founded,
dissolved) — a candidacy dated exactly on a dissolution date belongs to the successor,
so a same-day handover has neither a gap nor an overlap. A string may legitimately be
claimed by two parties when their windows are disjoint; that is how succession is
modelled, and it is why `Green / Ecology` (a label the local-government dataset uses
across 1981-2011, spanning both organisations) can be attributed correctly.

Checks:

  1. CONTRADICTION -- the string is claimed for this body, but no party's window covers
     the date. Either a lifespan is wrong, or the string is being used for something
     that is not that organisation, or the label outlived/preceded the party.
  2. AMBIGUITY -- more than one party's window covers the same candidacy. A registry
     bug, not a data finding.
  3. GAP -- founding to first recorded contest.
  4. UNRECORDED -- party strings with candidacies and no entry, ranked by volume.

It never INFERS a lifespan from the contest record. firstYear/lastYear in
data/browse/details/parties/ already do that, and the point of the explicit file is that
a party which stopped contesting has not thereby been dissolved.
