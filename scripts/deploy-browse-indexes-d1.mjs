/**
 * Regenerate the browse index SQL and load it into civgraph-elections, in one command.
 *
 * Same shape and the same reasoning as deploy-catalogue-d1.mjs. The lesson that script
 * records is worth repeating here rather than relearning: `check:` proving the generated
 * SQL matches the source says NOTHING about whether the database was loaded from it. A
 * green gate with a week-old database is the failure mode, and the only way to notice
 * used to be running a network check by hand. So this regenerates, loads, and verifies.
 *
 * WRANGLER AND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES: if R2 credentials are exported (as the upload
 * scripts require), wrangler tries to use them for D1 and fails with a bare
 * "Authentication error [code: 10000]". They are cleared for this call.
 *
 *   npm run deploy:browse-indexes            # all three
 *   npm run deploy:browse-indexes sources    # one
