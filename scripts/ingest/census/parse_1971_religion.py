"""Recover 1971 religion COUNTS from the printed County Reports.

WHY. The repo's 1971 religion layer (religion-1971-lgd.csv) is the CAIN retabulation:
district percentages on a community-style basis, with no counts and no not-stated. That
is fine for mapping a share, but it cannot be put on the same footing as 1981 and 1991,
both of which are enumerated stated-religion with an explicit not-stated residual. To
compare like with like -- which is the whole point of the 1981 boycott question -- 1971
has to be available as counts in the same six categories the other two years use.

An earlier attempt recorded in HISTORICAL_RELIGION_1971_2021.md concluded the 1971 OCR was
"too corrupt to parse safely -- only 2 of ~7 area blocks validate". This gets 6 of 7:
Tyrone, Fermanagh, Down, Armagh, Antrim and Londonderry.

Londonderry lost only its Roman Catholic PERSONS column. Its male and female columns
survived as 40,287 and 41,753, so the column is recoverable as the residual and then
checked against those two -- see recover_missing_category. All three totals close exactly:
82,040 + 39,821 + 31,443 + 2,181 + 25,045 = 180,530, and the same holds for each sex.

BELFAST COUNTY BOROUGH IS NOT RECOVERABLE, and for a different reason. Its report is laid
out the other way round -- each run is one category as 6 rows of (persons, males, females)
interleaved, so run 0 is the whole population block: 356,830 with five areas summing to
exactly that. Twelve such self-proving blocks survive, but no five of them sum to the
population on all three sexes, and all eleven non-population blocks together reach only
275,649 of 356,830. The two largest columns -- Roman Catholic and Presbyterian, on the
order of 112,000 and 85,000 -- never reach the candidate stream; the largest head present
is 42,475. Two missing columns against one identity cannot be corroborated, so the report
is skipped rather than guessed at.

Its population total is nonetheless known exactly, as the residual of Table 8's own total:
1,519,640 - 1,162,810 = 356,830, which is what run 0 independently reads.

The seven population totals do all survive, and they sum to 1,519,640. That is 16,425
below the 1,536,065 enumerated population, which is what Table 8's own note predicts: it
excludes people usually resident outside Northern Ireland and armed forces in barracks.
So the two failed reports failed on their religion columns, not their arithmetic.

STRUCTURE. The 1971 Census was published as seven County Reports (six counties plus
Belfast County Borough), each with its own TABLE 8 Religions covering that county and its
urban and rural districts. The categories are exactly 1981's: Population, Roman Catholic,
Presbyterian, Church of Ireland, Methodist, and a lumped 'Other and not stated'.

THE LAYOUT IS NOT CONSISTENT, WHICH IS THE WHOLE DIFFICULTY. Usually each (category, sex)
cell is one contiguous run with the county total first. But where the labels between
columns are lost the scan reads several columns ACROSS the page, emitting k columns as one
interleaved run of k*n values in which the county occupies indices 0..k-1. Splitting such
a run end-to-end instead lands mid-column and yields a district figure dressed as a county
total. Fermanagh settles the point: its 10-value Roman Catholic run interleaves persons
and males, and the alternate values sum to exactly 23,738 and 12,209.

Labels cannot arbitrate -- they are scrambled too, with the group header 'Population'
emitted after its own Persons column rather than before it. So everything is identified by
arithmetic:

    column_head   a column's first row is the county and the rest its districts, so a
                  correctly-located column satisfies seq[0] == sum(seq[1:])
    triples       (persons, males, females) grouped by P == M + F, not by position
    solve_by_sum  where a column was lost entirely and the sequential walk desynchronises,
                  the five religion columns are found by the identity they must satisfy
                  together, and only a UNIQUE solution is accepted

Two counties are read sequentially with all six sexes checked; three need the sum
identity, which reconciles by construction, so for those the independent evidence is the
uniqueness of the solution plus whichever sexes proved themselves. Every row records which
method produced it and how many of the six sex checks passed -- see the method and
sex_checks columns.

NOT-STATED IS NOT SPLIT OUT. Each report carries an 'Analysis of column headed Other and
not stated denominations', and its TOTAL is locatable: for all five counties exactly one
run holds a value equal to that county's other-and-not-stated, preceded by a plausible
'Other denominations*' and 'Not stated' pair. Tyrone's reads 57 then 7,232 against a total
of 19,179. It is NOT emitted, because the denomination components recoverable from the
other fragments sum to about 4,000, so 57 + 7,232 + 4,000 falls roughly 7,900 short of
19,179. The position is right and the arithmetic is not, which is exactly the case where a
figure should be left out rather than shipped on the strength of where it sits.
