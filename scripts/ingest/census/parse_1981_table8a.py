"""Parse Table 8A of the 1981 Census: the decomposition of Table 8's lumped
'Other and not Stated Denominations' column.

WHY THIS TABLE MATTERS. Table 8 reports religion by district, but collapses everything
that is not Catholic/Presbyterian/Church of Ireland/Methodist into one column. For the
1981 boycott question that column is the whole story, because it contains the not-stated
population -- and 1981's not-stated is the artefact under study. Without splitting it,
'Catholic share' can only be computed on a denominator that includes non-responders,
which is not comparable with any other census year.

Table 8A performs exactly that split, denomination by denomination, ending with three
summary rows: 'Other Denominations*', 'Not Stated', 'TOTAL'.

GEOGRAPHY IS THE CATCH, AND IT IS NOT FIXABLE HERE. Table 8A is published for Northern
Ireland as a whole (Summary Report) and separately for Belfast (Belfast Report). It is
NOT published per district. So the not-stated count is known for two areas only, and any
per-district figure must be modelled rather than read. That is a real limit on the
boycott analysis: non-response was geographically concentrated, so apportioning the NI
not-stated across districts in proportion to population would assume away the very
pattern being measured.

OCR DAMAGE AND THE ORACLE. The scan splits digits ('3 , 2 0 2'), reads 1 as 't' or 'l'
('t ,067', '61 1'), and leaves column rules as stray '|', '!' and 'r'. Rather than trust
any cleaning rule, every column is checked against two things it was not fitted to:

    sum(denominations) + Other + Not Stated == TOTAL      (internal, per column)
    TOTAL == the area's 'other_notstated' from Table 8    (external, already parsed)

A column that fails either is reported, not silently emitted.

Reads the column-wise OCR the same way as the ward tables: names form one contiguous
block, then the Persons, Males and Females blocks follow, aligned by position.
