/**
 * Regenerate the catalogue SQL and load it into D1, in one command.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The catalogue lives in two places: data/database/maps.json, which is authored and
 * reviewed in git, and the civgraph-catalogue D1, which is what /_api/catalogue serves.
 * `check:catalogue-sql` proves the generated SQL matches the file. NOTHING proved the
 * database had been loaded from it.
 *
 * So the gate could be green with D1 a week behind, and the only way to notice was to
 * run the network check by hand. In the week of 2026-08-22 that step was forgotten three
 * separate times -- after the 1921/1927 rename, after the 1915 rename, and after the
 * relative-URL fix -- each time leaving the live catalogue describing layers by their
 * old names while every offline check passed.
 *
 * A step that must be remembered after every catalogue edit is a step that will be
 * forgotten. This makes it one command, and verifies afterwards rather than assuming.
 *
 * WRANGLER AND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES: if R2 credentials are exported (as the upload
 * scripts require), wrangler tries to use them for D1 and fails with a bare
 * "Authentication error [code: 10000]". They are cleared for this call.
 *
 *   npm run deploy:catalogue
