/**
 * `site/_routes.json` must cover every Pages Function, and nothing else.
 *
 * WHY THE FILE EXISTS
 *
 * Without `site/_routes.json`, Cloudflare Pages routes EVERY request through the Functions
 * runtime, including the ones that just want a static file. The site is overwhelmingly
 * static -- one HTML shell, a bundle, tiles and JSON -- so nearly every invocation was
 * doing nothing but handing the request back.
 *
 * WHY IT NEEDS A VALIDATOR, AND WHY THIS ONE FAILS BOTH WAYS
 *
 * Getting the include list wrong is silent and asymmetric:
 *
 *   too NARROW -> an API path stops reaching its Function and is served as a static
 *                 asset. The endpoint 404s, or worse, a SPA-style fallback answers with
 *                 HTML at HTTP 200, which every status-code check reads as healthy. This
 *                 project has already had two outages of exactly that shape.
 *   too WIDE   -> the file exists but saves nothing, which looks like it is working.
 *
 * So this derives the routes from the `functions/` tree and compares both directions. A
 * new Function with no matching include fails here rather than in production.
 *
 * Files beginning with `_` are helpers, not routes (`_auth.js`, `_error.js`,
 * `_method.js`, `_schema.js`, `_proni-shell.js`), and are excluded the way Pages excludes
 * them.
 *
 * Offline, so it belongs to `check:` rather than `verify:`.
