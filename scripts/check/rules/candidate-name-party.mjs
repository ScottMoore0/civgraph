/**
 * A candidate whose whole name is a word of their own party's name is always wrong.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CATCHES
 *
 * Something in the ingest that produced the 2014 and 2019 Northern Ireland local government
 * bundles split a "Name, Party" string in the wrong place and put the TAIL OF THE PARTY into
 * the candidate name field:
 *
 *     name="Party"    party="SDLP"        <- ...Social Democratic and Labour PARTY
 *     name="Voice"    party="TUV"         <- Traditional Unionist VOICE
 *     name="Ireland"  party="Alliance"    <- Alliance Party of Northern IRELAND
 *     name="Féin"     party="Sinn Féin"   <- Sinn FÉIN
 *
 * 62 candidate rows across 19,199. They reached the persons index as four "people" --
 * name-party with 47 elections, name-ireland with 7, name-voice with 5, name-fein with 3 --
 * and from there into the election panes and the semantic graph.
 *
 * WHY THE RULE IS SHAPED THIS WAY
 *
 * The whole name must be a SINGLE WORD, and that word must belong to THAT CANDIDATE'S OWN
 * party. Both halves of that are load-bearing, and the reason is Denis Ireland.
 *
 * Denis Ireland was a real Northern Ireland senator and writer. Boyd Ireland is likewise a
 * real candidate. A rule that flagged any name CONTAINING a party word would delete them
 * both. A rule that flagged single-word names generally would delete legitimate bare
 * surnames, which are common in older sources. A rule that compared against ALL party names
 * rather than the candidate's own would flag anyone surnamed Green, Alliance or Unionist.
 *
 * Measured before this was written: the rule as implemented flags 62 rows, all four of the
 * known artefacts and nothing else. "Denis Ireland" and "Boyd Ireland" are untouched because
 * their names are two words.
 *
 * THE ABBREVIATION TABLE
 *
 * data/browse/parties.json cannot answer "what is SDLP short for" -- every entry has an
 * empty observedNames, and the file is polluted with occupation strings ("SDLP (Teacher)",
 * "Farmer SDLP"). So the expansions live here, explicitly, where they can be read and
 * argued with. Only parties that actually appear in the defect are needed; adding more is
 * safe but pointless.
 *
 * Offline, so this belongs to `check:` rather than `verify:`.

// the failure this file exists to catch.
//
// So they are pinned, the way check:local-paths pins its known offenders. The gate stays
// green, every existing case stays visible and counted, and a NEW one fails the build. The
// pinned rows are incomplete data and should be marked as such at the source, once whoever
// holds the original candidate lists can supply the names.
// The baseline stores a COUNT per identity, not a set of identities.
//
// One constituency file can legitimately contain the same artefact twice -- Newry and Mourne
// 2014 has two "Party | SDLP" rows -- so file|name|party is not unique. Stored as a set, 63
// rows collapsed to 60 keys, and a genuinely new third occurrence in an already-pinned file
// would have passed silently. That is the same false-green shape as a check that verifies
// something other than what it just did, so it is counted instead.
