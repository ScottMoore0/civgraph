/**
 * Two catalogue records pointing at the SAME file must not credit disjoint providers.
 *
 * WHY
 *
 * lgd-1966 ("Rural and Urban Districts 4 July 1966") and admin-areas-1966-07-04
 * ("Administrative Areas 4 July 1966") both serve
 * data/maps/local-government/LGDs_04-07-1966.fgb -- same file, same date, same
 * labelProperty -- and credited DIFFERENT providers: XrysD and OSNI. One file cannot have
 * two disjoint origins, so one of those credits was simply wrong, and nothing reported
 * it. (Settled 2026-08-23: XrysD is correct; admin-areas-1966-07-04 was corrected.)
 *
 * This is the second attribution defect found in a week. The first was
 * counties-ireland-1955 losing its OSI credit while its sibling provinces-1955 kept it,
 * caught only because a browser test happened to assert on it. Attribution errors are
 * invisible in the UI -- a wrong credit renders exactly as confidently as a right one --
 * so they need a checker rather than a reader.
 *
 * DISJOINT, NOT MERELY DIFFERENT. A record may legitimately credit a SUPERSET of a
 * sibling's providers: eds-ulster-2019 reuses the 1921 digitisation file and credits
 * ["Tailte Eireann", "Phelim Birch"] where eds-ulster-1921 credits ["Phelim Birch"],
 * because the 2019 statutory designation comes from Tailte while the geometry is the
 * older digitisation. That is added provenance, not a contradiction. Only sets that
 * OVERLAP IN NOTHING are reported.
 *
 * Offline, so it belongs to `check:` rather than `verify:`.
