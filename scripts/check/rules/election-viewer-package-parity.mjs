/**
 * Guard the duplicated data/elections-source assets.
 *
 * There are two copies of the viewer's js/ and css/:
 *
 *   data/elections-source/       <- original; its data/ tree is a LIVE BUILD
 *                                     INPUT (scripts/build/build-test2-election-manifest.mjs
 *                                     reads data/elections + elections_index.json)
 *   app/election-viewer-package/   <- the copy production actually serves
 *                                     (index.html + sw.js + _headers reference
 *                                     /app/election-viewer-package/*)
 *
 * Neither copy can simply be deleted: the root tree is required to build, and
 * the app/ tree is required to serve.
 *
 * scripts/build/app-bundle.mjs copies root -> app/ on every build, so the copies
 * cannot diverge *while builds are run*. What this validator catches is the gap
 * either side of that:
 *
 *   1. Someone edits app/election-viewer-package/* directly — reasonable, since
 *      that is the copy production serves — and the next build silently reverts
 *      it. Fails here first, before the work is lost.
 *   2. Someone edits the root copy and commits without rebuilding, leaving the
 *      committed app/ copy (the served one) stale.
 *
 * MIRRORED must stay in sync with the `assets` list in
 * scripts/build/app-bundle.mjs (~line 119). If you add a mirrored file there,
 * add it here.
