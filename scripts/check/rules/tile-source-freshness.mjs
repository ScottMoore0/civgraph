/**
 * The render tiles must be newer than the source they were built from.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * On 2026-08-16 a contributor's corrected geometry was applied by replacing the
 * PUBLISHED DOWNLOAD -- data/maps/.../ROI_Local_Authorities_1915.fgb -- and
 * nothing else. That file was verified sha256-identical to what he submitted,
 * three times, and he was told three times that the fix was live. It was not.
 *
 * The map does not render from the download. Per the README: "MapLibre GL
 * rendering PMTiles vector tiles; FlatGeobuf is a download format, not a render
 * path." The tiles are built by build-test-pmtiles.mjs from a THIRD copy of the
 * geometry in render/source-cache/vector-intake/, and that copy was untouched --
 * dated 29 May, still holding the pre-correction boundary. So the download was
 * right, the catalogue was right, the cache tokens were right, and the map drew
 * the old boundary for a day and a half.
 *
 * Measured at the time, Antrim/Londonderry vertex counts in the served archive:
 *
 *   before   66087 / 31749
 *   after    66768 / 32473     (the contributor's delta was +719 / +732)
 *
 * WHAT THIS CHECKS, AND WHY IT IS THE WEAK VERSION
 *
 * That every layer's built PMTiles archive is at least as new as the source-cache
 * file it is built from. That catches "source updated, tiles not rebuilt", which
 * is exactly what happened.
 *
 * It does NOT catch "published download updated, source cache not updated", which
 * is the step BEFORE the one that failed here -- the source cache is gitignored
 * and the download lives in R2, so there is no offline way to compare them. That
 * gap is real and is recorded rather than papered over: whoever applies a
 * geometry correction must update the source cache, not just the download, and
 * `npm run verify:tiles` is the network check that would notice.
 *
 * A SECOND GAP, found 2026-08-21, and it is larger than the first.
 *
 * This compares MODIFICATION TIMES. It therefore fails when a source is newer than its
 * archive, and cannot fail when the archive is newer and wrong. niah-buildings' archive
 * was 19 MB where its source yields 204 MB, and carried ten attribute columns where the
 * source has twelve -- built from an older version of that source, and passing here
 * every time, because an archive fetched from R2 gets a fresh mtime for free. An mtime
 * is evidence about a filesystem operation. It is not evidence about content.
 *
 * Do not read a PASS here as "the archives are current". It means only that no source
 * on disk is newer than the archive beside it.
 *
 * `npm run verify:tile-staleness` is the content-level counterpart: it compares each
 * PUBLISHED archive's attribute schema against its source, which is the symptom niah
 * showed. That check has its own limit, stated in its header -- a source re-cut with
 * corrected geometry and identical columns is invisible to it, which is exactly what
 * happened to the ROI local-authority layers in August. Between them the two checks
 * cover mtime drift and schema drift. Neither covers geometry drift, and nothing
 * currently does.
