/**
 * Every repository path a document points at must exist.
 *
 * WHY
 *
 * `scripts/bundle.mjs` was cited as a real command in BOTH CLAUDE.md and
 * README.md. It has not existed since the Leaflet stack was archived; the file is
 * `archive/legacy-scripts/bundle.mjs`. In CLAUDE.md it illustrated "treat a
 * successful build as a fact" with a command that cannot run. In README.md it was
 * the documented way to build the site.
 *
 * Worse, README.md's whole structure section described a `js/` directory that was
 * renamed to `src/` in fb5d246cad. That stale section is where the belief that
 * "src/ is the dead Leaflet stack" came from -- a belief that reached
 * docs/review/TECH-DEBT-AUDIT.md item 4 and eslint.config.mjs, and cost 36,028
 * lines of live code its linting for as long as it survived.
 *
 * A pointer to a path is a checkable claim, unlike most prose. check:doc-status
 * asserts a document declares a status; this asserts a document's paths resolve.
 * Between them they cover the two ways these files rot that a machine can see.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY LIMITED. It checks paths that look like repository paths inside
 * backticks or a markdown table cell. It cannot check whether the surrounding
 * sentence is true -- "app/ is the live site" is unverifiable here, and pretending
 * otherwise would be the sort of check that passes for the wrong reason.
