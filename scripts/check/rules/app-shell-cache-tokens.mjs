/**
 * Keep index.html's and sw.js's ?v= cache tokens tied to the files they version.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, FOR THE THIRD TIME
 *
 * This is the third instance of one bug in one week:
 *
 *   browse/index.html   a July token on a file rewritten three times that
 *                       afternoon. Every fix deployed and none of them ran.
 *                       Presented as "the login button does nothing".
 *   /_api/.../schema    max-age=300 served a five-minute-old schema, so the
 *                       edit form rendered a textarea where a structured
 *                       control belonged. Indistinguishable from broken code.
 *   index.html          found 2026-08-16: the token said a65f867d6fc8 while
 *                       app/build/app.bundle.js hashed to 7734fe96a8e9, and
 *                       /build/main.css was stale too. Returning visitors were
 *                       running the previous bundle AND the previous stylesheet.
 *
 * scripts/check/rules/browse-cache-tokens.mjs closed the first. This closes the
 * third, which the first did not cover because browse/ and the app shell are
 * built by different machinery.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY CHECK-ONLY
 *
 * The browse validator rewrites tokens, because browse/ is hand-written and has
 * no build step to own them. The app shell is the opposite: the tokens are
 * WRITTEN BY BUILD SCRIPTS --
 *
 *   /app/build/app.bundle.js   and sw.js's VERSION   scripts/build/app-bundle.mjs
 *   /app/build/app.bundle.css                        scripts/build/app-bundle.mjs
 *   /build/main.css                                  scripts/build/shell-assets.mjs
 *
 * -- so a fixer here would be a second implementation of the same derivation,
 * and two things computing one value is how the value drifts. This reports the
 * mismatch and names the script that owns it. Fix by running the build.
 *
 * NOT EVERY TOKEN IS A PLAIN CONTENT HASH, WHICH THIS CHECK GOT WRONG FIRST TIME
 *
 * /app/build/* is sha256(file). /build/main.css is NOT: it is salted with
 * `_headers` and `sw.js`, because either can change how the stylesheet is
 * delivered without changing a byte of it. The first version of this validator
 * hashed the file directly, reported main.css as stale, and was right by
 * accident -- it was stale, but not for the reason given, and the same code
 * would have failed identically on a perfectly current token.
 *
 * So the salted derivation is IMPORTED from the build script that owns it rather
 * than reimplemented here. A check that reimplements the thing it is checking
 * can only ever verify that two copies of a mistake agree.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/check/rules/app-shell-cache-tokens.mjs

// `npm run build` stamps index.html's /build/main.css token from a salt, and then

// hash. While that line was part of the salt, the stamp was always computed over the
// PREVIOUS sw.js: one build left a stale token, and only a second consecutive build
// agreed with itself. Every commit touching app/src shipped returning visitors the old
// stylesheet, and nothing said so -- the stale token above was found by accident on
// 2026-08-20 while running the gate for an unrelated change.
//
// This asserts the property that makes the build converge rather than the symptom: the
// salt must not move when only the derived VERSION line moves. It is checked by feeding
// the real sw.js through with a deliberately different version stamp, so it fails if
// anyone puts the raw file back into the salt.
