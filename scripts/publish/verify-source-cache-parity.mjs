/**
 * The source cache must hold the same bytes as the published download.
 *
 * THIS IS THE HOP THAT FAILED, and until now nothing checked it.
 *
 * On 2026-08-16 a contributor's corrected geometry was applied by replacing the
 * published download in R2 and nothing else. That file was verified sha256-identical to
 * what he submitted, three times, and he was told three times the fix was live.
 *
 * It was not. The map renders from PMTiles built from a THIRD copy of the geometry in
 * render/source-cache/vector-intake/, and that copy still held the pre-correction boundary
 * -- dated 29 May. The download was right, the catalogue was right, the cache tokens
 * were right, the tiles were faithfully built from the source they had, and the map drew
 * the old boundary for a day and a half. Antrim was 66087 vertices where it should have
 * been 66768.
 *
 * Every check added since guards a LATER hop. validate-tile-source-freshness compares
 * the source against the archive by mtime; validate-tile-content-hash compares them by
 * content. Both would have passed that day, because source and archive agreed with each
 * other. They were agreeing on the wrong thing.
 *
 * HOW THIS IS CHEAP ENOUGH TO RUN
 *
 * Not by downloading 671 archives. R2 returns the content MD5 as the ETag for any
 * single-part upload, so one HEAD request and one local md5sum settles a layer exactly.
 * Verified against two files before relying on it, including the corrected 1915 layer:
 *
 *   East and West of the Bann.fgb    ETag 843c2558…  local md5 843c2558…
 *   ROI_Local_Authorities_1915.fgb   ETag abc360d6…  local md5 abc360d6…
 *
 * A multipart upload produces "<md5>-<partcount>" instead, which cannot be compared this
 * way. Those are reported as unverifiable rather than passed, because "could not check"
 * and "matches" must never look the same in this file of all files.
 *
 * THE HOP BEFORE THIS ONE IS NOT GUARDED, AND CANNOT BE FROM HERE.
 *
 * The pipeline has four hops. Three now have a check:
 *
 *   upstream provider -> published download    NOTHING
 *   published download -> source cache          this file
 *   source cache -> archive, by content         check:tile-content
 *   source cache -> archive, by timestamp       check:tile-freshness
 *
 * The first is unguarded and that is accepted rather than pending. Verifying it means
 * knowing what the provider actually supplied, which is a checksum recorded at INGEST --
 * information that does not exist for anything already published and cannot be
 * reconstructed after the fact. Re-downloading from the provider proves only that the
 * provider serves what it serves today, which is a different claim and quietly wrong
 * whenever a source has been revised upstream.
 *
 * The practical consequence: a corrupted or wrong file published to R2 will pass every
 * check in this repository, because everything downstream faithfully agrees with it.
 * What protects that hop is the review at the point of ingest, not automation.
 *
 * WORTH DOING FOR NEW INGESTS: record the provider's checksum, or failing that our own
 * hash of the file as received, in the catalogue entry at the time it is added. That
 * makes this hop checkable going forward without pretending to have checked the past.
 *
 * Network-dependent: verify:, never check:.
 *
 *   npm run verify:source-cache
 *   npm run verify:source-cache -- --ids <id,id>
