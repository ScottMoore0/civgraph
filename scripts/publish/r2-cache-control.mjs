/**
 * Give R2 objects an explicit Cache-Control, because absent is the worst value.
 *
 * THE FAILURE THIS FIXES
 *
 * data.civgraph.net served every map object with NO Cache-Control header --
 * only ETag and Last-Modified. That is not "no caching"; it hands the decision
 * to the browser's heuristic, which RFC 9111 4.2.2 suggests be a fraction of the
 * document's age, commonly 10%. Sampled across the bucket on 2026-08-16, map
 * objects carried Last-Modified dates in early April, roughly 133 days back,
 * which buys about THIRTEEN DAYS of freshness during which a browser does not
 * even revalidate.
 *
 * That is how five corrected Local Authority layers went live on 2026-08-16,
 * byte-verified at the edge, and stayed invisible to the contributor who
 * supplied them.
 *
 * Read the shape of that failure carefully: staleness scales with the age of the
 * file, so the longer a layer has sat unchanged, the longer a correction to it
 * takes to arrive. The cache behaves worst precisely where the data is most
 * established and a correction matters most.
 *
 * WHY max-age=3600 AND NOT THE 86400 USED BY THE PAGES PROXY
 *
 * functions/data/maps/[[path]].js sends max-age=86400 with a week of
 * stale-while-revalidate, and its comment explains why it moved there from
 * `immutable, max-age=31536000`: a re-upload to an existing key was not being
 * picked up. This is the same argument carried one step further by evidence. A
 * day of hard freshness on a key that gets corrected in place is a day of
 * serving known-wrong geometry with no way to intervene, and that day has now
 * actually cost something.
 *
 * An hour of freshness covers the repeat fetches within a browsing session,
 * which is what caching is for here. After that, stale-while-revalidate=86400
 * means the visitor still gets an instant answer from cache while the refresh
 * happens behind them, so the cost of the shorter window is one background
 * conditional request, not a slower page. Against an 8 MB body a 304 is free.
 *
 * NOTE THE INTERACTION WITH CACHE TOKENS
 *
 * Rewriting metadata is a CopyObject, and scripts/build/stamp-map-cache-tokens.mjs
 * derives its `?v=` token from the object's ETag. If a copy changed the ETag,
 * every token in the catalogue would silently stop matching the file it names.
 *
 * MEASURED on the 2026-08-16 run: R2 preserved the ETag across all 10,917
 * copies -- for a simple (non-multipart) copy it stays the content MD5, so no
 * restamping was needed. That is an observation about today's R2, not a promise.
 * Run this after any future backfill:
 *
 *   npm run verify:map-tokens
 *
 * and if it fails, the fix is:
 *
 *   node scripts/build/stamp-map-cache-tokens.mjs --write
 *   (the next publish loads maps.json into D1 with the records)
 *
 * MEASURE WITH GET, NOT HEAD
 *
 * Cloudflare does not run its cache layer on HEAD, so `curl -I` reports a
 * different and misleading set of headers. The 2026-08-16 diagnosis was made
 * that way and had to be corrected twice. Use:
 *
 *   curl -s -o /dev/null -D - <url>
 *
 * WHY THIS DOES NOT TOUCH THE WHOLE PREFIX
 *
 * data/maps/ holds 1,221,020 objects and 48.2 GB, of which 1,207,367 are PNG
 * raster tiles and only 6,489 are FGB. The tiles DO NOT NEED THIS. Measured with
 * GET, a tile already returns `Cache-Control: max-age=14400` -- injected by a
 * zone-level Browser Cache TTL -- and `cf-cache-status: HIT`, so it is both
 * cached in the browser and served from the edge without reaching R2.
 *
 * That zone setting only reaches responses Cloudflare already considers
 * cacheable by extension. `.png` and `.gz` qualify. `.fgb` and `.geojson` do
 * not: they returned NO Cache-Control at all and `DYNAMIC`, which is the gap
 * this script closes. Anything Cloudflare will not cache by extension must carry
 * its own Cache-Control, because nothing else will supply one.
 *
 * So the default is the catalogue geometry family -- fgb plus its precompressed
 * .gz/.br siblings. Everything skipped is counted and reported by extension,
 * because a scope limit nobody can see reads as coverage nobody has. The
 * remaining genuinely-bare objects are the non-cacheable extensions in that
 * skipped list (.geojson confirmed, .json and .pbf likely), roughly 1,200
 * objects -- worth a run with --ext when convenient.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   (credentials: .env.local at the repository root, loaded by r2-env.mjs)
 *   node scripts/publish/r2-cache-control.mjs                        # dry run
 *   node scripts/publish/r2-cache-control.mjs --apply
 *   node scripts/publish/r2-cache-control.mjs --ext png --apply      # widen if wanted
 *   node scripts/publish/r2-cache-control.mjs --ext '*' --apply      # everything
