/**
 * Every published polygon layer must have a labelProperty, or be a known nameless one.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GUARDS
 *
 * labelProperty is what draws a feature's name. Without it a polygon shows nothing on
 * hover or selection, and nothing complains -- MapLibre renders no text for a missing
 * attribute exactly as silently as it renders none for an absent setting. So the failure
 * mode is a layer that looks anonymous rather than broken.
 *
 * A MEASUREMENT CORRECTION WORTH KEEPING. This was first reported as "82 published
 * polygon layers show no name", measured from data/database/maps.json. That was wrong by
 * about three times. The RENDERER reads render/metadata/maps-test.json, and 54 of those
 * 82 already carried a labelProperty there; the two files were out of sync in the
 * direction that costs nothing. The real user-visible gap was 28, of which 6 had a usable
 * name in their tiles and now use it.
 *
 * This validator therefore checks the RENDER record, because that is the file the
 * renderer reads.
 *
 * THE ALLOWLIST IS NOT A BACKLOG. The 22 layers in
 * data/database/nameless-polygon-layers.json were each checked against their own tiles:
 * flood extents, noise contours, elevation bands and water bodies carrying only OBJECTIDs
 * and GUIDs. There is no name to show, so no labelProperty is the honest state. They are
 * listed so a NEW unlabelled layer fails here instead of joining them unnoticed.
 *
 * To add a layer to the allowlist, first run
 * `node scripts/build/tiles/assign-missing-label-properties.mjs` and confirm it reports no name-like
 * attribute. Do not add one to silence this check.
 *
 * Offline, so it belongs to `check:` rather than `verify:`.
