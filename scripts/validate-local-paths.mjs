/**
 * Fail on machine-specific absolute paths in scripts/ and analysis/.
 *
 * validate-approved-publication-path.mjs has long defined LOCAL_PATH_RE to keep
 * local filesystem paths out of published source records. The same rule was
 * never applied to code, and the gap was not theoretical:
 *
 *   - build-og-preview.mjs called createRequire() with an absolute path into one
 *     developer's checkout. check:og-preview did not fail in CI, it crashed with
 *     ERR_INVALID_ARG_VALUE before running -- and being the last of 19
 *     validators, it masked the fact that the rest had begun passing.
 *   - publish-converted-vector-layers.mjs carried the same path as an .env.local
 *     fallback, publishing a username and directory layout in a public repo.
 *   - analysis/border-poll-dry-run/v9 names the local path of the Pointer
 *     address dataset, which is never-public data.
 *
 * Two distinct harms: code that cannot run anywhere but one machine, and
 * disclosure of local layout in a public repository.
 *
 * BASELINE, NOT A BLOCKER. 31 files already violate this. Failing on all of
 * them would mean either a large mechanical scrub bundled into an unrelated
 * change, or a permanently red gate that everyone learns to ignore. Instead the
 * known set is pinned and only NEW violations fail, so the count can only go
 * down. Clearing a baselined file is reported so the pin can be tightened.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/validate-local-paths.mjs
 *   node scripts/validate-local-paths.mjs --update-baseline

// Deliberately NOT the LOCAL_PATH_RE from validate-approved-publication-path.mjs.
// That rule is correct for the data records it guards, where a bare \\ means a
// UNC path. Applied to source code it is wrong in both directions:
//
//   - \\ is an escape sequence in JS and Python, so replace('\\\\','/'), \\n and
//     regex literals all match. Measured: 49 of 192 flagged files matched on
//     that alternative alone, every sampled one a false positive.
//   - [A-Za-z]:[\\/] on its own matches 'https://' via the 's:', so every URL
//     in the repo would flag.
//
// A drive letter is a single letter followed by ':' and a separator, and is not
// preceded by another letter. That distinction is what the lookbehind encodes.
// Measured precision: 94 files flagged, of which the only false positives are
// the two that legitimately contain this pattern as a regex of their own.
//
// The second lookbehind covers a case the first cannot: a printf placeholder
// immediately before the separator, as in Python's '%s://%s' % (scheme, netloc).
// There the 's' of '%s' is preceded by '%' rather than a letter, so the drive-
// letter test passes and a URL built by interpolation flags. Excluding a '%'
// costs no real detection -- a hardcoded path does not begin '%C:\' -- and a
// path assembled from a placeholder is by definition not hardcoded.
