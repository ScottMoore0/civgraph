/**
 * Every published archive must record the exact source bytes it was built from.
 *
 * WHY THIS AND NOT THE FRESHNESS CHECK
 *
 * validate-tile-source-freshness.mjs compares modification times. It fails when a
 * source is newer than its archive and CANNOT fail when the archive is newer and wrong
 * -- and the second case is the one that happened. niah-buildings sat published at
 * 19 MB while its source yielded 204 MB, carrying ten attribute columns against the
 * source's twelve, and passed that check on every run, because an archive pulled from
 * R2 gets a fresh mtime for free. An mtime records a filesystem operation. It says
 * nothing about content.
 *
 * WHY NOT A SCHEMA COMPARISON. One was built first, and deleted on 2026-08-22 after
 * this replaced it. The record is kept here because the reasoning is the valuable part
 * and the code was not.
 *
 * It read attribute names back out of the built tiles and compared them against the
 * source. That cannot work, and not for want of care: MVT omits a field from any feature
 * whose value is null, so a tile's key dictionary is a LOWER BOUND on the schema, and
 * GDAL's writer drops a column that is null across everything it writes. A sparse column
 * and a dropped one are therefore indistinguishable in principle.
 *
 * Three generations of it reported 22, then 8, then 7 stale layers; each fall was a
 * defect in its own probe rather than a change in the corpus, and of the final 7 at
 * least five were artefacts. Seven archives were rebuilt and republished on the strength
 * of findings that did not survive checking. Two of them still reported stale after
 * being rebuilt from the exact source on disk minutes earlier, which is what finally
 * settled it.
 *
 * A content hash has none of that. It is exact or it is silent.
 *
 * COST: 3.3 seconds for the whole 2.9 GB source corpus, measured at 876 MB/s. No cache,
 * no mtime pre-filter, no cleverness -- those would reintroduce the assumption this
 * exists to remove.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, stated because the gap is the interesting one: whether the
 * SOURCE is itself current. In August the source cache held the stale copy and the
 * archive was built from it faithfully. Source and archive agreed; this check would
 * have passed while the map drew the wrong boundary. That hop is verify:source-cache.
 *
 * Offline. Skips layers whose source is absent, which on a clean checkout is most of
 * them -- the source cache is gitignored, so a green result here means much less on CI
 * than it does locally. Worth knowing before trusting it.
