/**
 * Every public page must carry the shared header, with the same core nav.
 *
 * WHY
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-17: five pages, five different nav sets.
 *
 *   /              Home Browse Apps Census About
 *   /browse/       Home Browse Apps About "Support Us"
 *   /apps/         Home Browse Apps About
 *   /pages/about   Home Browse Apps News About
 *   /render/         Home About
 *   /apps/proni-search/   a bespoke <header class="ps-header">, no shared nav
 *   /test2/        no header at all
 *
 * So "Census" was reachable only from the homepage, "Support Us" only from
 * Browse, and "News" only from About. Nothing checked it, which is how four
 * pages drifted apart. scripts/validate-test-shell-parity.mjs asserts that ONE
 * file contains the header class names; it never compares pages to each other.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ENFORCES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT
 *
 * The CORE set must be present and identical everywhere: it is the site's
 * skeleton and there is no argument for a page omitting it.
 *
 * Extras are REPORTED, not failed. Whether "Census", "News" and "Support Us"
 * belong in the global nav is an editorial decision about what the site
 * promotes, not something a validator should settle -- but the divergence should
 * be visible rather than discovered by a reader who cannot find a page.
 *
 * Offline: reads the committed HTML. It cannot see what the deployed page
 * renders, so it pairs with a real browser check rather than replacing one.

 * the most complete nav on the site -- Home, Browse, Apps, Census, About -- inside
 * a `<header class="site">` with a bare `<nav>`. So the check was reporting a
 * navigation failure on the basis of a class name, while the thing it exists to
 * protect (can a visitor get anywhere from here) was fine.
 *
 * Principle 1: verify the property that matters, not one adjacent to it. What
 * matters to a reader is the destinations. Markup divergence is real but is a
 * styling-consistency problem, so it is reported separately rather than dressed
