"""Total votes by party in Northern Ireland elections, 1970-2024.

Sums first-preference / FPTP votes across every NI contest in the window, and uses
data/elections/parties/party_lifespans.json to combine the strings that are the same
organisation -- 'UKUP' with 'UK Unionist Party', 'Ecology' with the pre-1990 half of
'Green / Ecology', and so on -- rather than reporting raw strings.

WHAT THIS NUMBER IS, AND IS NOT. It is a cumulative count of votes cast, over 54 years
and roughly 60 contests. It is not a measure of support, and comparing two parties'
totals is only fair if they contested the same elections. Three things drive it as much
as popularity does:

  * LONGEVITY. The UUP has been on ballots since 1921 and the TUV since 2009.
  * WHICH CONTESTS. Local elections have ~80-100 areas against Westminster's 12-18, so a
    party that fights local government hard accumulates votes faster.
  * STV vs FPTP. Under STV only first preferences are counted here, so a party that
    lives on transfers is understated relative to its actual influence.

Scope decisions, all of which change the answer:
  * NI bodies only. Dail, Irish European and Irish presidential contests are excluded.
  * Referendums excluded -- Yes/No are not parties.
  * The 1996 Forum's synthetic NI-wide row is dropped: it is the regional top-up list
    covering the SAME ballots as the 18 constituency rows, and including it double-counts
    that contest exactly (1,504,936 against a true 752,468).
  * By-elections included by default, with --no-byelections to drop them. Note the
    January 1986 file is titled a general election but is the 15 simultaneous
    resignations by-elections; it is treated as a by-election here.
