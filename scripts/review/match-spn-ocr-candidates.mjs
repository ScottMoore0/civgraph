/**
 * REVIEW SCRIPT -- reports only, writes nothing. Not wired into build or check.
 *
 * Can the 822 candidate records extracted from Belfast newspaper Statements of Persons
 * Nominated be joined to Civgraph's existing election data?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * archive/ocr/ holds LLM-extracted SPN data -- candidates with addresses, party
 * descriptions, PROPOSERS, SECONDERS and ELECTION AGENTS. Those last three are recorded
 * nowhere else in Civgraph. Publishing them means attaching each OCR candidate to a
 * candidate row in an existing contest, and the question that decides whether it is worth
 * doing is simply: how many of the 822 actually join?
 *
 * WHY MATCHING IS NOT DRIVEN BY THE EXTRACTED ELECTION NAME
 *
 * The obvious key -- the LLM's `election_name` -- is the least trustworthy field in the
 * file. Measured across the 70 records it carries 32 distinct values for perhaps a dozen
 * real elections ("Local Election 1985", "Local Elections 1985", "District Council Election
 * 1985" and "Local Elections (Northern Ireland) Order 1985" are one contest), 14 records
 * say "Unknown", and at least three are wrong outright:
 *
 *   - "Northern Ireland Parliamentary Election 1938" on a paper dated 1958-03-10
 *   - "Westminster General Election 1975" -- there was no 1975 Westminster general election
 *   - "Westminster General Election 1986" -- nor a 1986 one; that is the January by-elections
 *
 * Those are exactly the plausible-looking errors that make unverified LLM output dangerous,
 * and they would have propagated silently into a name-keyed join.
 *
 * So the join is proposed from EVIDENCE INSTEAD: the newspaper's own publication date
 * (encoded in the filename, and not LLM-derived) narrows the field to contests within a
 * window, and the winner is chosen by how many candidate SURNAMES the OCR record and the
 * Civgraph contest actually share. A mapping the candidate names agree with is a mapping
 * that has been tested; one asserted from dates alone is a mapping that has not.
 *
 * The hand-written overrides in data/database/spn-ocr-election-map.json are applied on top,
 * for records where the evidence is genuinely ambiguous, and this script reports where an
 * override disagrees with the evidence rather than silently preferring either.

 * NOMINATION STATUS -- a different axis from the count status Civgraph already records.

 * `candidates.status` in the election data holds Elected / Excluded / Not Elected. Every one
 * of those describes what happened to someone who WAS ON A BALLOT. A Statement of Persons
 * Nominated covers an earlier moment, and lists people who never got that far.
 *
 * The vocabulary is not invented here. It is column 6 of the statutory form itself:
 * "Decision of returning officer that nomination paper is invalid, or other reason why a
 * person nominated no longer stands nominated". Read against the notice, a nominee is in
 * exactly one of three states:
 *
 *   nominated  column 6 blank -- validly nominated, went to the poll (or was returned
 *              unopposed), and SHOULD join to a Civgraph candidate row
 *   withdrawn  "no longer stands nominated" -- stood down after nomination, never appeared
 *              on a ballot, and CANNOT be in results-derived data
 *   invalid    the returning officer rejected the nomination paper -- likewise never on a
 *              ballot
 *
 * This matters for how the match rate is read. Civgraph's election data is derived from
 * RESULTS, so a withdrawn or invalid nominee failing to join is the correct outcome, not a
 * defect. Counting them as failures is what made the headline rate look worse than the data
 * is: 14 of the 77 scans carry withdrawal language and they cluster in the lowest-scoring
 * files.
