/**
 * REVIEW SCRIPT -- reports only, changes nothing. Not wired into build or check.
 *
 * Finds entries in the browse persons index that are not people.
 *
 * WHY
 *
 * buildPersons() mints a person from every candidate name it sees. That is right for
 * candidates and wrong for anything else that lands in the name field, and two classes of
 * non-person had already reached the index:
 *
 *   - referendum options. "Yes" and "No" carried 1,207 elections each and were the only
 *     two records too large for a single D1 statement. Fixed 2026-08-25 by skipping
 *     referendums at the source.
 *   - PARTY-NAME FRAGMENTS. "Party", "Voice", "Féin" and "Ireland" are the tails of
 *     "...Labour Party", "Traditional Unionist Voice", "Sinn Féin" and
 *     "...of Northern Ireland". This is what the script reports.
 *
 * TRACED TO THE SOURCE, not guessed. In civgraph-elections:
 *
 *     name="Party"  party="SDLP"  local-government-...__2014-05-22   11 rows
 *     name="Party"  party="DUP"   local-government-...__2019-05-02   10 rows
 *     name="Voice"  party="TUV"   local-government-...__2014-05-22    4 rows
 *     name="Féin"   party="Sinn Féin"  local-government-...__2014-05-22  3 rows
 *
 * So the defect is in the CANDIDATE ROWS, not in buildPersons: the ingest that produced
 * those bundles put a fragment of the party name into the candidate name field. It is
 * confined to Northern Ireland local government, 2014 and 2019.
 *
 * That matters for where to fix it. Cleaning it in buildPersons would tidy the persons
 * index and leave the candidate rows wrong -- and those rows are what the election panes,
 * the semantic graph and any future analysis all read.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
 *
 * It does not delete anything, and it deliberately does not offer a blanket rule. A bare
 * surname can be a real person in older sources, and "stood for 4+ parties" is NOT an
 * artefact signal: 155 people match it, including Eamon de Valera, who genuinely stood
 * for four parties across his career. Any rule aggressive enough to catch the artefacts
 * automatically would delete real people.
