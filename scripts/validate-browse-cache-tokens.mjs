/**
 * Keep browse/index.html's ?v= cache tokens tied to the files they version.
 *
 * WHY
 *
 * browse/index.html loads browse.js and browse.css with hand-written tokens
 * (`?v=20260708-sources-sharded`). On 2026-08-15 that token had not changed
 * since July while browse.js had been rewritten three times that afternoon, so
 * browsers kept running the cached copy. Every fix deployed correctly and none
 * of them ran. It presented as "the login button does nothing", and the tell was
 * buried in the script's own src attribute.
 *
 * A token that is only correct while somebody remembers to change it is not a
 * cache-busting mechanism, it is a trap. build-test2-app.mjs already solves this
 * properly for the metadata index by deriving the token from a content hash;
 * browse/ is hand-written rather than built, so it needs this instead.
 *
 * NOW RUNS INSIDE `npm run build`, as of 2026-08-21. It was previously only reachable
 * as build:browse-cache, which meant the token was correct whenever somebody remembered
 * to run it and the gate caught them when they did not. Deriving a value on every build
 * is better than checking it after the fact; the --check mode stays as the backstop.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT: the pattern matches bare same-directory filenames only. If browse/ ever
 * grows a subdirectory of assets, references to them are silently uncovered rather than
 * reported. Worth widening before that happens, not after.
 *
 * DO NOT normalise line endings before hashing here. It is tempting -- this repository
 * stores CRLF and deploy runners check out LF -- but browse/index.html is committed and
 * served as-is rather than rebuilt on the runner, so the raw bytes are the right input.
 * Normalising produces a different hash than the committed token, which reads as a stale
 * token and invites someone to "fix" a value that was correct. That mistake was made and
 * reverted on 2026-08-21.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/validate-browse-cache-tokens.mjs           # rewrite tokens
 *   node scripts/validate-browse-cache-tokens.mjs --check    # fail if stale
