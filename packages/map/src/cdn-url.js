/**
 * Build URLs for assets served from the boundaries-data R2 bucket.
 *
 * Bulk assets live on data.civgraph.net rather than in the Pages deployment,
 * which has a 20,000-file limit the site had already exceeded. The bucket's
 * CORS policy allows https://civgraph.net and not localhost, so on a dev server
 * cross-origin fetches are routed through the /_r/ proxy instead. Image tags do
 * not need this -- <img> is not CORS-restricted -- but fetch() of a manifest is,
 * and keeping both on one code path avoids a class of works-in-prod-only bug.
 *
 * mapController._rewriteForDevProxy does the same rewrite for tile and FGB URLs.
 * It predates this module and is left alone deliberately: it sits on the hot path
 * for every tile request and is not worth disturbing for tidiness.
