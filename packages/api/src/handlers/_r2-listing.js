/**
 * Shared R2 listing, used by both the gated and the public index.
 *
 * WHY A LISTING ENDPOINT EXISTS AT ALL
 *
 * R2 public buckets cannot list. Neither r2.dev nor a custom domain exposes ListObjects, so
 * https://data.civgraph.net/ and /data/ both 404 identically -- the bucket is readable by
 * key and not enumerable. That is not a setting that can be turned on; enumeration has to
 * be served by something holding the bucket binding, which is this.
 *
 * DELIMITED, NEVER FLAT
 *
 * The bucket holds about 1.93 million objects, most of them feature thumbnails and
 * point-cloud tiles. A flat listing would be hundreds of megabytes, useless to a reader,
 * and would exhaust the request before finishing. Every call therefore passes
 * delimiter: '/', so one request describes one directory level: its immediate child
 * prefixes and the objects sitting directly in it.
 *
 * PAGINATION IS NOT OPTIONAL. R2 list() returns at most 1,000 entries per call and sets
 * truncated with a cursor. A prefix with 100k objects is 100 round trips, so the cursor is
 * surfaced to the caller rather than looped here: looping would move the timeout from the
 * client to the edge, where it fails less visibly.
 *
 * COST. list is a Class A operation, the more expensive tier. A person browsing is
 * negligible; an unattended crawler is not, which is why the public route caches and the
 * gated route sits behind Access.
