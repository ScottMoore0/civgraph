/**
 * Record an approve/reject decision on a queued contribution. Administrators only.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
 *
 * Approving does not apply anything. It sets `status` on the queued record and
 * nothing else: no catalogue write, no R2 write, no commit. Turning an approved
 * submission into a change is done by scripts/intake/contributions.mjs, run by
 * the owner on their own machine, which produces a git branch for review.
 *
 * That split is deliberate and is the whole security model. If approval wrote
 * directly to the catalogue, the boundary between "requesting" and "enacting"
 * would rest on this file being correct -- on requireAdmin, on the allowlist
 * parsing, on there being no way to reach the endpoint with a forged header.
 * Instead the boundary rests on who can push to main, which GitHub enforces and
 * which no bug in this file can weaken. The worst a flaw here can do is mark a
 * submission approved that the owner never wanted; they still have to run the
 * apply step and merge the result.
 *
 * Usage:  POST /_api/contributions/decide
 *         { "key": "submissions/2026-08-13/sub_...json",
 *           "decision": "approved" | "rejected", "note": "..." }
 *
 * The moves a decision may make are functions/_lib/contribution-status.js: from pending-review
 * only; a submission already decided answers 409.
