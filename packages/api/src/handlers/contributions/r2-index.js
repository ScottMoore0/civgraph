/**
 * Enumerate the whole R2 bucket. Access-gated, contributors and admins only.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM data-index
 *
 * There are two different questions. "What may the public see" is answered by
 * /_api/data-index, which serves only the publication allowlist. "What is actually in the
 * bucket" is this, and it deliberately ignores the allowlist -- because the point of an
 * audit view is to show the things nobody approved.
 *
 * That distinction is not hypothetical. On 2026-08-31 six prefixes were publicly readable
 * without ever passing the allowlist: data/deprivation/, data/nisra-files/,
 * data/nisra-portal/, data/pointclouds/, data/polling/ and data/thumbnails/. Finding that
 * required S3 credentials and a local script, because nothing in the deployed system could
 * answer "what is in here". This closes that gap.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES UNDER contributions/
 *
 * It was at /_api/r2-index and was unreachable by everyone, including correctly listed
 * contributors. The Access application covers the path `_api/contributions` and nothing
 * else -- deliberately, see login.js -- so Access never intercepted /_api/r2-index, never
 * issued a JWT for it, and requireContributor found no identity to check.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-08-31, which is how the two cases are told apart:
 *
 *     /_api/contributions/whoami   302   Access intercepts, redirects to sign-in
 *     /_api/r2-index               401   falls through to the Function, no identity
 *
 * A 401 alone looks like a normal "not signed in" refusal, which is why this survived
 * review. Sitting inside the protected prefix means the protection is inherited from the
 * path rather than depending on Zero Trust config staying in step with the repo.
 *
 * ACCESS CONTROL is the same gate the rest of contributions uses: Cloudflare Access
 * supplies a signed identity, and requireContributor checks it against
 * CIVGRAPH_CONTRIBUTORS / CIVGRAPH_ADMINS. An unset allowlist means CLOSED -- see _auth.js.
 *
 * Every entry is flagged with whether it falls inside the publication allowlist, so the
 * unreviewed prefixes are obvious rather than needing to be cross-referenced by hand.
 *
 *   GET /_api/contributions/r2-index                    top level
 *   GET /_api/contributions/r2-index?prefix=data/       one level down
 *   GET /_api/contributions/r2-index?prefix=data/maps/&cursor=...&limit=500
