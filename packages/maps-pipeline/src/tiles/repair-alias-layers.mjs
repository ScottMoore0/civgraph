/**
 * An alias layer must describe the same tiles as the layer it aliases.
 *
 * WHY ALIASES EXIST. Where a boundary set did not change between two years, the later year
 * does not get its own PMTiles archive -- it points at the earlier year's. eds-roi-1953's
 * Munster variant serves eds-munster-1950's tiles because Munster's divisions were
 * unchanged. That is deliberate deduplication, not an error, and 149 layers rely on it.
 *
 * WHAT DRIFTED. Nine of those 149 were left with status 'converted' instead of
 * 'converted-alias', and with a '?v=civfid1' cache-bust appended to their tileUrl that
 * their targets do not carry. Nine tileUrls out of 963 carry that query string and they
 * are exactly these nine, so they are leftovers from a hand-edit during the civ_fid
 * conversion rather than anything a script emits -- no script in the repo contains the
 * string. The other 140 aliases are correct.
 *
 * The effect is mild but real: an alias and its target request the same archive under two
 * different URLs, so a viewer who loads both fetches the file twice and caches it twice.
 *
 * The invariant is simply that an alias carries its target's tile description. That is
 * what validate-test-app.mjs checks and what this restores, by copying from the target
 * rather than by pattern-matching the defect, so any future drift in these fields is
 * repaired too.
 *
 * Idempotent. Safe to run after any metadata step.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/build/tiles/repair-alias-layers.mjs [--check]
