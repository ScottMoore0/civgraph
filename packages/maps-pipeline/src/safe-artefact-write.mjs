/**
 * Write a generated JSON artefact, refusing to silently drop records.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-07-31 a scoped run of promote-test-converted-layers.mjs
 * (--ids limited to 19 new layers) rewrote render/metadata/maps-test.json wholesale from
 * its conversion report and deleted 15 unrelated, working layers: wards-1972,
 * wards-1984, wards-1993, wards-2001, wards-2012, lgd-1984, eds-1971, eds-1977,
 * eds-1980, eds-1983, baronies-all-ireland, pc-2023, stormont-1920,
 * assembly-areas-2023 and ni-townlands-1844.
 *
 * Their PMTiles archives were untouched and still returned 200, so nothing looked
 * broken from the data side: the tiles existed, the catalogue still listed the layers,
 * and only the renderer's index had lost them. The site degraded in ways that read as
 * unrelated bugs -- wards-2012 still worked because its variants survived, wards-1993
 * loaded raster scan sheets because only its raster variants remained resolvable, and
 * wards-1972 and wards-1984 did nothing at all. Several hours went into diagnosing a
 * regression that was minutes old.
 *
 * The generator reported success throughout. It had no idea it had deleted anything,
 * because "rewrite the file from what I was asked to process" is indistinguishable from
 * "delete everything I was not asked to process" unless something compares the two.
 *
 * THE RULE. A generator may add and update freely. Removing a record is a deliberate act
 * and must be requested explicitly, because the overwhelmingly common cause of a
 * disappearing record is a filtered run, not an intentional retirement.

/**
 * Merge freshly-computed records over the existing ones, keyed by id.
 *
 * writeArtefactJson above is the right tool when a generator produces the WHOLE
 * collection every time: anything missing is a bug, so refusing is correct. It is the
 * wrong tool for a deliberately scoped run, which produces a partial collection on
 * purpose and would simply be refused every time -- and a check that always fires gets
 * bypassed, which is worse than not having it.
 *
 * This is the other half. `--ids` runs describe the rows they touched and nothing else,
 * so their output must be merged into the artefact rather than substituted for it.
 *
 * WHY BOTH HALVES ARE NEEDED. On 2026-08-19 a five-layer `verify-test-pmtiles-cdn
 * --ids` run replaced all 819 rows of cdn-range-report.json with 5. The next
 * write-test-cdn-upload-manifest run read that truncated report, could no longer see
 * that 814 archives had been verified remotely, and dropped their `remoteVerified`
 * flags. One scoped run, two corrupted artefacts, no error from either tool. The
 * absence of a merge path is why the July rule did not cover this.
 *
 * Existing order is preserved and new records are appended, so a scoped run produces a
 * minimal diff instead of reshuffling the file.
