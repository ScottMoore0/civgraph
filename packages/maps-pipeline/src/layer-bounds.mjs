/**
 * Is a layer's bounding box plausible for what the layer is?
 *
 * The default envelope is an Ireland bounding box. That is the right guard for the great
 * majority of layers here -- a boundary set that claims to reach Kazakhstan has a broken
 * extent, and a broken extent makes the map jump somewhere absurd when the layer loads.
 *
 * IT LIVES IN ONE PLACE BECAUSE THREE SCRIPTS APPLY IT AND THEY MUST AGREE.
 * promote-test-converted-layers.mjs uses it to decide whether to register a layer at all,
 * validate-test-app.mjs and validate-test-tile-budgets.mjs to decide whether to fail the
 * build. They had three separate copies that had already drifted:
 *
 *   - Two rejected a degenerate box (min === max) and one did not.
 *   - Only one knew about the DoBIH hill layers.
 *   - tailte-ferry-crossing had to be exempted twice, in two files, for the same reason.
 *
 * A DEGENERATE BOX IS VALID. A layer whose features all sit at one point -- a single
 * bicycle warning sign, a national COVID figure pinned to a centroid -- has zero extent,
 * and that is its correct extent. An INVERTED box (south above north) is a real defect and
 * still fails.
 *
 * SOME SUBJECTS ARE LEGITIMATELY WIDER THAN IRELAND, and each says so by name rather than
 * by loosening the default for everything. Ferry crossings run to Britain and France; the
 * seas layer covers both islands and their approaches; the DoBIH hill database covers
 * Britain as well.
