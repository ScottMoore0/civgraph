## What Civgraph does

Civgraph is a free, open site for exploring the administrative geography and political history of the island of Ireland. You can look up any townland, ward, constituency, or census area; see how boundaries have changed over time; and browse election results and demographic data.

## What's inside

Hundreds of map layers covering every major administrative geography on the island of Ireland, from the 19th century to the present day.

- **Maps and Boundaries** - Local government districts, wards, DEAs, parliamentary constituencies, Assembly areas, townlands, civil parishes, baronies, counties, and more. Browse by era with the time slider.
- **Elections and Results** - Assembly, Westminster, local government, European Parliament, and referendum results. Full STV count animations, candidate and party entity pages, and constituency-level visualisations.
- **Census and Demographics** - Small Areas, Output Areas, Super Output Areas, Data Zones, and settlement boundaries from NISRA and the CSO.
- **Physical Geography** - Rivers, watersheds, seas, regional divides, and land classifications.
- **Built Environment and Communities** - Peacelines, railways, travel-to-work areas, settlements, and place names.
- **Spatial Search** - Find any boundary feature by name across all map layers.
- **Time Slider** - Explore how boundaries have changed decade by decade.
- **Conditional Styling** - Dynamic map styling based on data attributes.

## How it's built

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Maps | [MapLibre GL](https://maplibre.org/) rendering [PMTiles](https://protomaps.com/docs/pmtiles) vector tiles; [FlatGeobuf](https://flatgeobuf.org/) is a download format, not a render path |
| Build | [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) with code splitting and performance budgets |
| Search | [Fuse.js](https://www.fusejs.io/) for map search, spatial index for feature search |
| Geospatial | [Turf.js](https://turfjs.org/) for area/length calculations |
| Testing | [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) |
| Hosting | [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) + [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) |

## Run the site on your computer

```bash
# Install dependencies

> Some scripts named below were archived in November 2026 (ARCHIVE.md, "Archived scripts"); they are in the archive copies and in git history, not in `scripts/`.
npm install

# Build JS bundle + minified CSS
npm run build

# Start local server
python -m http.server 5050

# Open http://localhost:5050
```

## Project structure

**Read this before anything else. Several directory names are historical and will
mislead you.** This section is the canonical layout;
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) covers the workflow that goes with it.

| Path | What it actually is |
|---|---|
| `app/` | **the live site** — MapLibre GL. Built bundle in `app/build/`, committed. |
| `src/` | shared browser modules, served **unbundled**. Live, not legacy. |
| `render/src/` | shared renderer source; `app/` builds from it |
| `render/metadata/` | the render catalogue — see "three stores" below |
| `tests/` | the Playwright suite |
| `test2/` | the retired-app kill switch (`test2/sw.js`, the same bytes as `render/sw.js`); `/test2/` itself answers 301 to `/maps/`. Not a directory of tests. |
| `apps/` | standalone apps (PRONI search). Unrelated to `app/`. |
| `browse/` | the Browse page — hand-written, no build step |
| `pages/` | standalone pages (About, Census Explorer) |
| `functions/` | Cloudflare Pages Functions |
| `scripts/` | build, validation and data pipelines — **not deployed** |
| `data/database/` | the tracked catalogue: `maps.json` and friends |
| `data/maps/` | geometry, served from **R2**, not from this repository |

Superseded code that used to sit in `archive/` left the repository in November
2026; `ARCHIVE.md` says where it went and how to get it back.

Two traps in particular:

- **`src/` is not the old Leaflet stack.** `js/` was *renamed* to `src/` when
  Leaflet was retired, and only the dead parts moved to archive/leaflet/ (since
  moved out of the repository: see `ARCHIVE.md`). What
  is left is live and load-bearing — `app/src/app.js` imports it on line 3. This
  README described `js/` as the entry point for months after that rename, which is
  where the "src/ is dead" belief came from; it cost 36,028 lines of live code its
  linting. See `docs/review/TECH-DEBT-AUDIT.md` item 4.
- **`app/` and `apps/` are different things**, as are `render/`, `test2/` and
  `tests/`. Renaming them is planned but invalidates clones, so it is scheduled
  rather than done: `docs/directory-rename-runbook.md`.

### The catalogue is three stores

The single most confusing thing here, and getting it wrong reliably produces
convincing but false "this layer is broken" diagnoses. Joined by a bare string id,
with a `-vector-test` suffix on the render side.

| Store | Owns |
|---|---|
| `data/database/maps.json` | provenance — licence, attribution, downloads |
| `render/metadata/maps-test.json` | rendering — tiles, zoom, styling, labels |
| `c1Cards` in `src/ui-controller.js` | navigation — what a user can click |

`render/metadata/maps-test-index.json` and `render/metadata/layer-details-test2/` are
**generated** from `maps-test.json`: edit the source, then run
`node scripts/build-test2-metadata-shards.mjs`. The client fetches the generated
detail shards, so editing only `maps.json` leaves the site showing the old values.

All three edges are guarded by validators in `npm run check`.

### Which URL comes from where

| URL | Source |
|---|---|
| `/` | `index.html` + `app/build/` (from `render/src/`) + `src/` + `build/` |
| `/browse/` | `browse/` |
| `/apps/`, `/apps/proni-search/` | `apps/` |
| `/pages/about`, `/pages/census-explorer` | `pages/` |
| `/render/`, `/test2/`, `/test/`, `/maps/test/` | retired apps: 301 to `/maps/` (`_redirects`); their old service workers are retired by `render/sw.js` |

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

That chains seven steps; the two that produce the served bundles are
`scripts/build-shared-shell-assets.mjs` (CSS, critical-CSS inlining, thumbnail
manifest) and `npm run build:test2` (the MapLibre app). Produces:

- `app/build/app.bundle.js` — the app bundle, **committed** to the repository
- `app/build/app.bundle.css`
- `build/main.css` — deferred CSS, split from `assets/css/main.css`
- `build/main.critical.css` — inlined into `index.html` by the build

The build enforces performance budgets and fails if CSS exceeds 225 KB.

Each of those is referenced from `index.html` with a `?v=` cache token derived
from the file's content hash. **Never hand-edit a token** — `npm run check` fails
if one does not match, because a stale token means returning visitors keep running
the old file. `scripts/validate-app-shell-cache-tokens.mjs` explains why.

This file told you to run a bundle script at scripts/bundle.mjs until 2026-08-17.
There is no such file — it moved to archive/legacy-scripts/ when the Leaflet
stack was retired, and archive/ has since left the repository (`ARCHIVE.md`). `npm run check` now verifies that every repository path these
documents cite actually resolves, so that particular lie cannot recur.

## Spatial index

The feature search index can be rebuilt from FlatGeobuf sources:

```bash
node scripts/build-feature-index.js
```

This generates:
- `data/database/spatial-index.json` - Monolithic index (fallback)
- `data/database/spatial-index/*.json` - Per-map chunks (loaded on demand)
- `data/database/spatial-index/_names.json` - Lightweight search index (~3 MB)
- `data/database/spatial-index/_manifest.json` - Chunk manifest

## Tests

```bash
npx playwright test
```
