# Lessons Log

## 2026-02-23

### 1) Always verify chunk manifest paths against real files
- Mistake pattern: Treated Townlands chunked loading as valid without revalidating manifest-to-file mapping.
- Impact: Immediate map-load failure (`Failed to load ... after 0.0s`).
- Guardrail: Before enabling `chunked: true` for any map, run a path-existence check for every `chunks[].file` and `zoomFiles.*.file`.

### 2) Point selection logic must be layer-capability based
- Mistake pattern: Point-hit logic depended too narrowly on geometry type string.
- Impact: Historic point feature double-click/click selection failed for some point-like layer cases.
- Guardrail: Use `layer.getLatLng()` as the primary point-layer capability check and pixel-distance hit tests.

### 3) Pause/play controls need a single robust interaction contract
- Mistake pattern: Pause/play UI state drifted between icon classes and mode/state logic.
- Impact: Button appeared stuck or non-responsive after pause.
- Guardrail: Keep explicit, deterministic icon-state transitions in click handler and validate pause->play->resume behavior after each change.

### 4) AGENTS.md process rules are mandatory, not optional
- Mistake pattern: Did not keep `tasks/lessons.md` updated after user corrections.
- Impact: Repeated regression classes were not captured promptly.
- Guardrail: After every user correction, append/update `tasks/lessons.md` in the same working pass before marking task complete.

### 5) Maintain a single canonical task ledger
- Mistake pattern: Split task tracking across `TASKS.md` and `tasks/todo.md`.
- Impact: Process drift and stale plans, violating AGENTS requirements.
- Guardrail: Keep all active and historical task tracking in `tasks/todo.md` only; keep `TASKS.md` as a deprecation pointer only.

### 6) Validate by workflow path, not only by helper function intent
- Mistake pattern: A fix looked correct in isolated logic, but the actual UI workflow still regressed.
- Impact: Load/unload and pause/play issues reappeared despite prior targeted edits.
- Guardrail: Validate full user interaction paths (click -> callback -> state refresh -> icon swap) and add explicit state synchronization where UI wiring has multiple entry points.
