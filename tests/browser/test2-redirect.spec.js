/**
 * `/test2/` is a compatibility redirect, and these are the only two things about it that
 * are still true and still worth guarding.
 *
 * It used to be the staging app. The MapLibre stack was promoted to `/` and test2/ was
 * reduced to two files: an index.html that preserves search and hash and calls
 * location.replace('/'), and a service worker whose only job is to unregister the legacy
 * /test2/ worker and clear its caches.
 *
 * test2-app.spec.js was that app's acceptance suite. Forty-two tests kept navigating to a
 * route that immediately became `/`, so thirty passed for the wrong reason and twelve
 * failed on assertions about a path that no longer serves anything. That file is now
 * pointed at `/`, where it belongs, and the /test2/-specific behaviour lives here.
 *
 * Two tests, not forty-two. A redirect has very little surface, and pretending otherwise
 * is what produced a suite asserting things nobody had checked in months.
 *
 * WHY test2/ IS KEPT AT ALL: a _redirects rule could do the first of these and cannot do
 * the second. A redirect never runs, so it can never unregister a service worker, and
 * anyone who loaded /test2/ before June 2026 still has that worker installed.
