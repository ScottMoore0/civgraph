/**
 * Coverage for the three behaviours that had none: timeline races, share-URL
 * restoration, and slider behaviour.
 *
 * WHY THESE THREE
 *
 * They share a property that makes them uniquely bug-prone and uniquely
 * untested: all are asynchronous, all mutate shared state, and all fail in ways
 * that leave the page looking fine. A timeline race ends with the map showing a
 * year the slider does not, and nothing throws. A broken share URL silently
 * drops to defaults, and the user simply sees the wrong place.
 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE DEBUGGING A FAILURE HERE
 *
 * app/src/boot.js starts the runtime inside a double requestAnimationFrame, and
 * Chrome does not fire requestAnimationFrame in a hidden or backgrounded tab.
 * A run where the browser window is not foregrounded will show no map, no
 * canvas, no catalogue fetches and no __civgraphTest2 — a completely convincing
 * dead site that is in fact healthy. This cost three debugging attempts on
 * 2026-08-11; see docs/src-orphan-runtime-check.md.
 *
 * Every test therefore waits on __civgraphTest2BootStarted FIRST and reports
 * that specific cause if it never arrives, rather than failing later on a
 * missing selector that says nothing about why.

  // KNOWN FAILURE, recorded rather than deleted or weakened.
  //
  // This found a real bug on the day it was written: requesting indices 0, 2
  // and 5 in quick succession settles on 0. The slider and the map agree, so
  // nothing looks wrong — they agree on a year the user already scrolled past.
  //
  // The cause is NOT applyIndex, which sets the slider synchronously in the
  // right order. It is the timeline REBUILD (app.js, the block ending in
  // setTimelineRangeIndex around line 1977): when a layer finishes loading, the
  // timeline is rebuilt and the index is re-derived from whichever layer is now
  // active. Whichever load finishes last therefore wins, regardless of what was
  // requested last.
  //
  // THREE ATTEMPTS SO FAR, ALL REVERTED. What each one established:
  //
  //  1. A generation token on applyIndex alone. No effect: the rebuild path
  //     never goes through applyIndex, so nothing consults the token.
  //
  //  2. Record the requested TIMESTAMP (not index -- the rebuild re-derives
  //     position from timestamps, and an index is only meaningful against the
  //     item list of the moment), have refreshTimelineFromActiveLayers prefer it
  //     over getCurrentTimelineTimestamp, and clear it when the latest request
  //     finishes. Still settled on 0. Clearing on completion is wrong: the
  //     slower earlier requests are still in flight, and each triggers its own
  //     rebuild when it lands, which then falls back to "whatever is on the map".
  //
  //  3. As (2), but hold the claim until a rebuild arrives whose item list no
  //     longer contains the requested timestamp. Moved the result from 0 to 2 --
  //     better, still wrong. An INTERMEDIATE rebuild, running while a load is in
  //     flight, produces an item list that does not contain the requested
  //     timestamp (the list is derived from a reference map that is mid-swap),
  //     so the claim is released early and the next landing load wins.
  //
  // So the remaining problem is narrow and specific: distinguishing "this
  // rebuild has genuinely moved to a different chain" from "this rebuild is a
  // transient mid-swap view of the same chain". Attempt 4 should probably not
  // key on the item list at all -- more likely on the in-flight load count, or
  // by having the swap itself carry the request identity so a stale completion
  // can be dropped before it ever reaches the rebuild.
  //
  // ATTEMPT 4 (2026-08-17) — request identity. Insufficient, and it narrowed the
  // problem usefully: the slider settled on index 0 with the token guard in place, so
  // the reset was not coming from applyIndex at all.
  //
  // ATTEMPT 5 (2026-08-21) — FIXED, and the first attempt arrived at by measurement.
  //
  // Attempts 1-4 all reasoned about where the reset might come from. Attempt 5
  // instrumented every write to the slider with a stack trace and read the answer off
  // the first run. Six of nine writes came from one chain:
  //
  //   setTimelineRangeIndex <- setTimelineItems <- updateTimeline
  //     <- updateActiveLayers <- onChange
  //
  // Three defects, each hidden behind the one in front of it:
  //
  //   1. updateTimeline re-derives the index from the max date of the CURRENTLY LOADED
  //      layers, which mid-swap is the old layer or none. It already refused to run
  //      while this.timelineApplying was set; applyIndex simply never armed that flag.
  //
  //   2. timelineApplying was a plain boolean shared by four overlapping call sites.
  //      Whichever finished FIRST cleared it for all of them and then called
  //      updateTimeline() itself -- and during a drag the earliest request is the one
  //      most likely to finish first. It is now a depth counter; only the last one out
  //      rebuilds.
  //
  //   3. With both fixed the internal index was right and the SLIDER still read 0,
  //      because timelineOnSelect unloads one layer and loads another, and three of
  //      those interleaving leave whichever pair finished last. applyIndex now queues,
  //      so a request superseded while waiting does no work at all -- it never loads a
  //      layer, so it cannot leave one behind. Dragging across ten steps performs one
  //      swap instead of ten.
  //
  // The lesson is cheaper than the four attempts that preceded it: instrument the write,
  // do not reason about the writer.
