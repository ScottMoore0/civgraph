// UX plan T3-08, the two sub-items that outlasted the rest. MEASURED 2026-08-23 and both
// are already correct, so these are guards rather than fixes. Recorded because the plan
// still lists them and the next reader would otherwise re-investigate.

// FIXED 2026-08-24. The fit was never broken; the RESIZE after it was unhandled.
//
// Measured through the load at 1280x800: before the results pane opens the map is 736px
// tall and the view already contains the whole layer (south edge 51.168 against the
// layer's 51.389). The pane then opens, the container halves to 374px, and MapLibre keeps
// the camera exactly where it was -- so the view loses 2.3 degrees of latitude, south
// edge 53.430, and the southern third of an all-island election is off-screen. That is
// what "12 of 18 constituencies below the fold" was describing.
//
// app.refitAfterElectionPane() re-fits once the pane has taken its space. After: zoom
// 6.10 -> 4.96, south edge 50.879, layer contained.
//
// My earlier "17 of 18 seat circles visible" reading was a WEAKER check that looked fine
// while this was broken: seat circles cluster where the seats are, not at the layer's
// extremes, so counting them never tested containment.
