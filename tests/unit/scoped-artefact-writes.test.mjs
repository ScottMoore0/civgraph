/**
 * A scoped run must describe what it touched, not redefine the artefact.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Twice now, a `--ids` run has quietly destroyed records it was never asked to consider.
 *
 *   2026-07-31  promote-test-converted-layers --ids <19 layers> rewrote maps-test.json
 *               from its own report and deleted 15 unrelated working layers.
 *   2026-08-19  verify-test-pmtiles-cdn --ids <5 layers> replaced all 819 rows of
 *               cdn-range-report.json with 5. write-test-cdn-upload-manifest then read
 *               that truncated report and cleared remoteVerified for 330 layers whose
 *               archives were fine. Measured, not estimated: 331 -> 1.
 *
 * Both tools reported success. "Rewrite the file from what I processed" and "delete
 * everything I did not process" are the same instruction unless something compares.
 *
 * The July incident produced writeArtefactJson, which refuses to shrink a collection.
 * That is the right rule for a generator that always produces the whole thing and the
 * wrong one for a deliberately partial run -- which is why the three tools in the
 * August incident had never adopted it. mergeArtefactRecords is the missing half.
 *
 * Run: node tests/unit/scoped-artefact-writes.test.mjs
